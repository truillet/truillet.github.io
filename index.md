I am "**Maître de conférences**" (tenure position between "associate professor" and "senior professor") in Computer Science since 2001 at the [Université of Toulouse](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr) and [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr) (*Toulouse, France*). I am mainly teaching in this university campus where I am also Director of Studies at [UPSSITECH engineering school](https://www.upssitech.eu).

From March to July 2014, I was an invited Professor at [University of Applied Sciences Ostfalia](https://www.ostfalia.de/cms/en), (*Wolfenbüttel, Germany*).

Previously, after my PhD, I worked at [CENA / DGAC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_d%27%C3%A9tudes_de_la_navigation_a%C3%A9rienne) as a researcher from 1999 to 2001 and at Toulouse-3 and Toulouse-Capitole universities as an assistant professor (1997-1999).

My current research focuses on modeling, design and development of "advanced interactive systems" -speech, gesture, tactile, tangible- interaction, mixed reality, etc. in complex situations (especially in the field of disability -blindness and motor disabilities-). I'm also very interesting in DIY (*Do-It Yourself*) field as support for creativity and innovation for research.
