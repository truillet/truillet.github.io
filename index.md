I am "Maître de conférences" (tenure position between "associate professor" and "senior professor") in Computer Science since 2001 at the University of Toulouse (France). I am mainly teaching on the University Paul Sabatier campus where I am also Director of Studies at UPSSITECH engineering school.

From March to July 2014, I was an invited Professor at University of Applied Sciences Ostfalia, Wolfenbüttel (Germany).

Previously, I worked at DTI R&D at DGAC as a researcher from 1999 to 2001, at Toulouse 3 and Toulouse 1 universities as a assistant professor (1997-1999).

My current research focuses on modeling, design and development of "advanced interactive systems" -speech, gesture, tactile, tangible- interaction, mixed reality, etc. in complex situations (especially in the field of disability -blindness and motor disabilities-). I'm also very interesting in DIY (Do-It Yourself) field as support for creativity and innovation for research.
